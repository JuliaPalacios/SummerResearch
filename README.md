# Undergraduate Summer Research in Statistics 2018
June 25 - August 17, 40hrs per week

*Instructor*: Julia Palacios, Sequoia Hall 141

*Group meetings*: Thursday, 11:00 am - 12:00 pm

*Individual meetings*: Monday

*Location*: Sequoia Hall 207

*Logistics*: We will have group meetings every Thursday and individual meetings every Monday. You are expected to show progress in every meeting.

*Seminars of interest*: Statistics seminar, Tuesdays 4:30PM, Sequoia Hall room 200 (refreshments provided in room 100 at 4PM).

*General instructions*: 
The main components will be reading papers, using in R with many graphics and simulations, and the analysis of real data. You can work on adapting a statistical method to analyze some data in order to answer a scientific question, develop statistical methodology to answer a scientific question or explore the statistical properties of existent methods.

You are expected to start working on your ﬁnal report from the start, so that you have a complete ﬁnal document when your research time is over (and not afterwards), so keep completing your report every week.

Keep an R-Markdown document or Jupyter notebook with your code and comment your code. Keep an updated git repository with your information. We will talk about this on June 29.

*Expectations*:
You will present your project proposal on June 29 in 10 minutes. You will describe the questions you want to answer and how you plan to answer them. You will also have a list of references you will read during the summer program.

Give two oral presentations, the first presentation of 20 minutes will be on Thursday July 27 about your progress and your final presentation of 40 minutes will be on Thursday August 16. 

Your first complete draft is due on August 10 and your final publishable paper is due on August 16.



# Journal reading

Part of our summer research will involve reading and discussing some scientific papers. I want to emphasize the importance of being a scholar. I ask you to read at least two papers a week, some of them will be discussed during group meetings and some will be uniquely relevant for your projects. When you finish reading your paper, write a short summary of your findings and annotate them here under Description. Please edit this list as needed.


| Date | Link to paper | Reader | Description
|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| June 27 | [Stochastic models and descriptive statistics for phylogenetic trees, from Yule to today](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/998929474)| All | write summary |


Put yourself on the calendar like this:

| Date | Link to paper | Reader | Description
|------|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| May 16   | [paper](https://...) | Julia | A very interesting paper |

| June 27 | [Stochastic models and descriptive statistics for phylogenetic trees, from Yule to today](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/998929474)| Kyle | This paper was a great introduction to trees and stochastic processes, but I found it also quite complicated and often confusing. Yule's 1924 paper proposes the idea of Yule processes and observes that phylogenetic trees are unbalanced, with a long-tailed distribution. Aldous also spoke of the branching process, based on a tree with shape (m,i), where m = size of parent clade and s = size of smaller daughter clade. Additionally, Aldous touches on selection and systematic biases as well as adaptive radiation. Aldous claims that more elaborate models are necessary, as numbers of species don't tend to increase or ddecrease very quickly, except in cases of mass extinction, which tend to be completely random. In summary, Aldous concludes that phylogenetic trees have observed imbalance. If macroecolutionary processes are to be amenable to mathematical modeling, we will have to continue refining our methods and metrics to model such processes. The Yule process is used to model macroevlolutionary events . Confusions/questions include the snakes table on page 24, the clades on pg. 27, the idea of adaptive radiation as well as the beta-splitting model (Appendix).
